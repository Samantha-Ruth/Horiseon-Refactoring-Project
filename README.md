# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Description

This project's goal was to refactor the coding behind an already existing Horiseon website.  The new code should increase the accessibility (and therefore increase the SEO score) as well as clean up the code to follow a nested html and .css style while maintaining the same look.

This project helped me further understand .html language and css styling, as well as using Git Hub.  There was a bit of struggle with positioning of the "content" and the "benefits" boxes and I hope to implement a further understanding of flexboxes and positioning properties in the future.
